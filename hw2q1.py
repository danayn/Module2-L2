'''
1. Nested Decisions: The Adventure Game üè∞
Objective:
To practice the use of nested if statements in creating a simple text-based adventure game.


Task 1: Code Correction *
You are provided with a Python script that is supposed to guide a user through an adventure game, but it has some errors. 
Identify and fix them.


Task 2: Setting the Scene *
Based on the corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. 
If the user chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark"
, and provide outcomes for each decision.


Task 3: Default Path *
If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, use the pass statement for now. 
Later, you can enhance this to provide feedback or a different branch of the story.
